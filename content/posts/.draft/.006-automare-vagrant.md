An integral component of incident response is time. Being able to quickly respond to a potential threat is important in limiting the damage done to an organization. I'd love to be able to quickly spin up a fresh environment every time that I wanted to investigate suspicious executables. In the past I've used vagrant to quickly spin up local development environments to learn how to code. I figured I should be able to do something similar with vagrant.

The stages of malware analysis grow in complexity: 
* Automated 3rd Party Analysis Tools
* Static Analysis
* Dynamic Analysis
* Manual Code Reversing

## Malware Lab Plans
For this malware lab we'll be building out this simple two-machine environment. I will be hosting the malware lab on my laptop (Dual Core i5 w/ 16 GB RAM). The linux machine will only need 2 GB RAM and 1 core and the Windows machine will need <TBD>. My virtual machine provisioner will be `virutalbox` and it will be managed using `vagrant`.

## Infrastructure-as-Code
Infrastructure-as-Code (IAC) is the practice of codifying machine management and lifecycles. IAC is considered advantageous over repeatative manual management tasks associated with workstation development, testing, deployment, management, and destruction. In a forensic environment, it is best to present each investigation with a clean, freshlyl built environment in order to confirm the analysis environment has not been corrupted by any previous malware analysis activities and to be able to prove so with a clean base image.

I want a small, lightweight malware analysis environement I can deploy on a laptap. To do this, I'll use `vagrant` to spin up virtual machines on `virtualbox`. If you haven't already, install [`Vagrant`](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation) and [`Virtualbox`](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
