## Overview
When ["Yet another SSH Honeypot written in Go"](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/7uxywp/yet_another_ssh_honeypot_in_go/) appeared in my Reddit feed I wondered why there are so many SSH honeypots written in Go. Is it because the standard library makes this task more accessible? Or is it the familiarity with the SSH service that makes it the hello-world of honeypots? Perhaps both? This post explores these questions by comparing and contrasting codebases.

## Go SSH Honeypots Overview
I compared a few Go SSH honeypots in order to search for patterns among popular repositories and among less popular repositories. This section contains an overview of each repository.

### `jaksi/sshesame`
Last updated in 2018, at the time of this writing [`sshesame`](https://github.com/jaksi/sshesame) is the most popular Go ssh honeypot with a whopping 1,100 stars. It describes itself as, "a fake SSH server that lets everyone in and logs their activity." It accepts and logs the following requests without executing anything on the host: password authentication, SSH channel open, SSH. Doesn't work well out of the box, no documentation to go on so you'll spend a while tinkering before you'll get it up and running.

### `sahilm/hived`
Last updated in  2017 [`hived`](https://github.com/sahilm/hived) has 2 stars.
