I want to share with you how I was able to pick up the Hugo framework and spin up a SSL encrypted website. If you are considering hosting a blog I highly recommend you give it a try, you can get started for the price of take-out dinner. In this post I'll be providing CLI instructions to interact with your Goocle Cloud project using Google Cloud SDK. You must authenticate to GCP using the SDK before you can manage resources. If the CLI isn't your thing you can do all of these steps through the GCP GUI with some common sense and maybe a few google searches. 

## Purchase a domain name

Purchase your domain name for your website. Don't worry about making your first website perfect, you can always buy another domain name! 

## Build a basic blog site with hugo
To [get started with Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) you can install from source or using the `brew` package manager.

```
brew install hugo
```

Verify installation with `hugo version`. We can quickly build a new site using `hugo new site`:

```
hugo new site sitename
```

Most pages will automatically be generated, like index.html. You need only seed the appropirate vairables in the `config.toml` file generated by the previous command. You can now add site content with:

```
hugo new post/hello-world.md
hugo new about/about.md
```

Test your changes with a dynamic server that updates whenever you update your site files:

```
hugo server -D
```

Enter the `localhost:1313` URL into your browser to see the development site. Depending on your environment, your port number may change. Navigate to the port number seen in the output of `hugo server -D`. Note, you can quickly stylize your site using [hugo themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/), this is beyond the scope of this post but you'll find ample documentation on this topic in public forums. 

## Host your Site on GCP

We'll need a bucket that we'll open to the internet so that we can serve up webpages. Name the bucket the name of your website.

```
gsutil mb gs://www.MYSITENAME.com
```

Now upload the contents of the hugo site to your GCP bucket

```
gsutil cp -r public/* gs://www.MYSITENAME.com
```

Give the world read permerssions to everything in the bucket. For this reason it is important you do not store confidential information in your public bucket.

```
gsutil iam ch allUsers:objectViewer gs://www.MYSITENAME.com
```

Set your home and your error pages.

```
gsutil web set -m index.html -e 404.html gs://www.MYSITENAME.com
```
