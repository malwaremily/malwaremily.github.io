# MAG TAG 

I recently started tinkering with a neat little weekend project-- a Mag Tag! A Mag Tag is an ESP32-S2 board with a 2.9" greyscale E-Ink with little magnet feet to stick the board securely to a refrigerator or a metal shelf! ðŸ’–

You can read about the Mag Tag and all its features [here](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4800) and if you want the whole kit you can get one [here](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4819). 

Tinkering with this device has been a lot of fun! I love that it can communicate over WiFi so I can do fun stuff with APIs. The E-Ink display is also nice, it is 296x128 pixels; each pixel can be white, light grey, dark grey, or black.

This would be a really cool gift for a techie. You don't need to get the whole kit, but I think the magnet feet and the battery are things that are semi-required to get the most fun out of this device!

If you're trying to configure your Mag Tag, I highly recommend using the Adafruit guide! Linked [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-magtag).  And also I also recommend reading esptool documentation linked [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/en/latest/esp32/). 

I found that I needed to give the esptool a few more flags than what I read in the Adafruit guide so I decided to document how I got started on an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS machine.

## PROGRAMMING THE MAG TAG

After connecting the Mag Tag to the computer using a USB-C cable that can transfer data, I found I could not see this new device in /dev/. This was expected, to see it, the Mag Tag needs to be in bootloader moder by slow-clicking the Reset button while holding the Boot0 button down. 

You really gotta click these buttons in the right way so I'm going to write how to do it in another way just in case that helps anybody. This should be done in the following order:
* Press and hold the Boot0 button down
* Press then release the Reset button
* Now you can release the Boot0 button

Sometimes I would return back to the gif of someone else clicking the buttons in proper sequence the Adafruit guide linked [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-magtag/rom-bootloader).

## FINDING THE MAG TAG

Check to see if the MagTag is available using this command:
```
$ ls -l /dev/ttyS*
```

The user guide says that most linux users will probably see the device under `/dev/ttyS87`. For me the it was `/dev/ttyACM0`, and could be found using this command:
```
$ ls -l /dev/ttyA*
crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 166, 0 Jan 10 00:05 /dev/ttyACM0
```

When I have issues seeing the device in `/dev/` I found that it was usually because I was failing to press the Boot0 and Reset buttons in the right way. This is also what was reported by other users as a common issue based on a quick DuckDuckGo search.

## USE ESPTOOL TO PROGRAM THE ESP CHIP

The following command was used to communicate with the Mag Tag using esptool:
```
$ sudo python3 -m esptool --port /dev/ttyACM0 -b 912600 -c 'esp32s2' chip_id
esptool.py v3.2
Serial port /dev/ttyACM0
Connecting...
Chip is ESP32-S2
Features: WiFi, No Embedded Flash, No Embedded PSRAM, ADC and temperature sensor calibration in BLK2 of efuse V1

MAC: mac_addr

Warning: ESP32-S2 has no Chip ID. Reading MAC instead.

WARNING: ESP32-S2 chip was placed into download mode using GPIO0.
esptool.py can not exit the download mode over USB. To run the app, reset the chip manually.
To suppress this note, set --after option to 'no_reset'.
```

Sometimes this command didn't work for me-- here is an example of what I saw when the Mag Tag failed to enter the bootloader:
```
$sudo python3 -m esptool --port /dev/ttyACM0 chip_id
esptool.py v3.2
Serial port /dev/ttyACM0
Connecting....
Detecting chip type... Unsupported detection protocol, switching and trying again...

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/esptool.py", line 377, in detect_chip
    res = struct.unpack("<IBBBBBBBBI", res[:16])  # 4b flags, 1b flash_crypt_cnt, 7*1b key_purposes, 4b chip_id
struct.error: unpack requires a buffer of 16 bytes

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python3.8/runpy.py", line 194, in _run_module_as_main
  [...trimmed output :) ...]
OSError: [Errno 71] Protocol error
```

While the output would change sometimes slightly, the error message was always the same: <b>OSError: [Errno 71] Protocol error.</b> 

The solution to this was to try re-pressing the Boot0 and Reset buttons again and again with slight variations in timing until the command returned information. ðŸ™ƒ

## Installing the Firmware Binary

After talking to the esp32s2 chip using esptool its time to download the CircuitPython binary and UF2 files provided by Adafruit linked [here](https://circuitpython.org/board/adafruit_magtag_2.9_grayscale/). 

After navigating to the directory that contains these files, I used the following command to upload the CircuitPython binary file:
```
$sudo python3 -m esptool --port /dev/ttyACM0 --after=no_reset write_flash 0x0 CircuitPython7_1_0/adafruit-circuitpython-adafruit_magtag_2.9_grayscale-en_US-7.1.0.bin

Staying in bootloader.
```

The install was very short, about a minute or less. After clicking the Reset button on the Mag Tag, the bootloader code for Circuit Python Magtag v7.1.0 that was just programmed is launched. Four (4) neopixel lights on the front of the MagTag briefly flash red then turn solid green and I hear and see a notification for a newly mounted device: MAGTAGBOOT.

![Mag Tag Device Back](/img/046-007.png)

Navigate to the MAGTAGBOOT device. You'll see three files:
* CURRENT.UF2
* INDEX.HTM
* INFO_UF2.TXT

## Installing the UF2 Booloader

Now I need to [upload the U2F loader](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-magtag/install-uf2-bootloader), the drag and drop bootloader from Adafruit. I grab the U2F file by unzipping the TinyUF2 release package `tinyuf2-adafruit_magtag_29gray-0.8.0.zip` found [here]( https://github.com/adafruit/tinyuf2/releases/tag/0.8.0). Then I unzipped the downloaded file to extract the `combined.bin` file.

I accessed the bootloader again by holding the Boot0 button down and clicking the Reset button. I see the `MAGTAGBOOT` device unmount. Run this command to confirm the connection to `/dev/ttyACM0`:
```
$ sudo python3 -m esptool --port /dev/ttyACM0 -b 912600 -c 'esp32s2' chip_id
```

Once a successful connection is seen--  double-click the Reset button on the Mag Tag to launch the bootloader. Again, it may take a few tries before you get the timing right. You'll see the device flash red and then remain green again once completed.

We're ready to load the second bootloader using the following command:
```
$sudo python3 -m esptool --port /dev/ttyACM0 write_flash 0x0 combined.bin 
esptool.py v3.2
Serial port /dev/ttyACM0

WARNING: ESP32-S2 chip was placed into download mode using GPIO0.

```

Once the U2F has been loaded onto the booloader, hit the Reset button. I now see MAGTAGBOOT on disk again. Okay, nearly done, now I need to drag the PythonCircuit U2F file onto the board: `adafruit-circuitpython-adafruit_magtag_2.9_grayscale-en_US-7.1.0.uf2` . Once the data is finished transferring, the device will restart and remount itself. The attached Mag Tag device is now called CIRCUITPY.

### WHAT GETTING STARTED WITH MAG TAG LOOKS LIKE

Woo! I can now start coding. The Mag Tag can now be dynamically updated using the files populated in this the top-level folder for CIRCUITPY. The Mag Tag will run any code in the file `code.py` or `main.py`.

Okay so now its time to download the latest CircutPython Library Bundle from here: https://circuitpython.org/libraries

Before I can program a CircuitPython file, I'll need to locally install CircuitPython dependencies. After creating a new folder within MAGTAGBOOT called lib, I copied the following folders and files to MAGTAGBOOT/lib: 
* adafruit_bitmap_font
* adafruit_display_text
* adafruit_io
* adafruit_magtag
* adafruit_portalbase
* adafruit_fakerequests.mpy
* adafruit_miniqr.mpy
* adafruit_requests.mpy
* neopixel.mpy
* simpleio.mpy

Don't worry too much about having missing libraries. You will see an error message telling you which library is missing. Here is an example of what it looks like when the Mag Tag is trying to run code with a missing `adafruit_request.mpy` library.

The Adafruit guides begins with a CircuitPython Internet Test example, linked [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-magtag/internet-connect). It was super quick to get up and running. Just drag the sample files over and configure them to use the segmented network in use for IoT devices. 

At the end of the Adafruit guide I walked away with some experience loading firmware and bootloaders using esptool.

Here are a few fun projects that come as example code out-of-the-box from the CircuitPython Library.
