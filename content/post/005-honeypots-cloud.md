Updated 2021-03-01: Give the reader a heads up that restarting SSH will kick them from their current session.

## Overview
Honeypots are useful tools for collecting unauthorized interactions as logs. These logs can be digested to identify new attacking techniques or observe active username/password patterns. In the context of a security team, it could provide actionable information to pre-emptively secure the studied environment. 

This tutorial will discuss general SSH honeypot pre-configuration, `HoneyTrap` installation, logging, and analysis. A [docker continer](https://hub.docker.com/r/HoneyTrap/HoneyTrap/) is used to launch a low interaction SSH honeypot `HoneyTrap`. Check out the [HoneyTrap documentation](https://docs.HoneyTrap.io/manuals/) for more information about `HoneyTrap` and what `HoneyTrap` can do. 

## Pre-Configuration
The honeypot workstation for this tutorial is GCP e2-micro instance running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
### SSH Service
To log unauthorized interactions with the SSH service the default port `22` will be used by the fake honeypot service. The real SSH service will need to be moved to another port. For this tutorial port `1025` is used. 

First change the SSH service port number by editing `sshd_config`.

```
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Where the file reads... 

```
# What ports, IPs, and protocols we listen for
```

...change `Port 22` to `Port 1025` and uncomment `ListenAddress 0.0.0.0` and `ListenAddress ::` as shown below.

![sshdconfig](/img/005-sshdconfig.png)

Please wait to restart the SSH service else you may lock yourself out.

### Firewall Changes
Use `ufw` to open up the new port for the SSH service.

```
$ sudo ufw allow 1025/tcp
Rules updated
Rules updated (v6)
```

Restart the ssh service with `sudo systemctl restart sshd`. If you connected to this VM over SSH you'll be kicked at this point.

Now go to the GCP console and navigate to the firewall for the managed instance. In the firewall rule table, click on the name "default-allow-ssh" > Edit. Navigate to "Protocols and Ports" and change the specified port from `22` to the desired port number, we'll use port `1025` for this example.

Now add another rule for wild traffic on port `22`. You should now be able to login from the custom port `1025` and honeypot traffic should be able to communicate out port `22`.

Return to the honeypot instance. If you are SSH-ing in from the console, use the drop-down selector and choose "Open in browser window on custom port" to login using port `1025`.

### Install Docker
Almost done with pre-configuration. Finally, [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

## Honeypot Installation
At this point you should be able to install and run any functioning docker honeypot on port `22`. We are using `HoneyTrap` for this tutorial because of ease of installation: you can pull the container and run it on port `22` with this command:

```
sudo docker run -ditp 22:8022 honeytrap/honeytrap:latest
```

Be sure to run the container in detached mode `-d` so that after you log out of the terminal session the container continues to run.

You can confirm the docker container is running with the command `docker container ls`:
```
$ sudo docker container ls
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                        COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                            NAMES
713be5f8fa05   honeytrap/honeytrap:latest   "/honeytrap/honeytra…"   33 seconds ago   Up 32 seconds   5900/tcp, 0.0.0.0:22->8022/tcp   happy_freebird
```

Logs can be viewed by running `sudo docker logs CONTAINER_NAME`:
```
$ sudo docker logs angry_chatterjee
2021/03/01 18:30:18 Using config file /config/config.toml

```

### Observing traffic
Verify this honeypot is running by attempting to login from a remote client. As `HoneyTrap` runs on the GCP host, custom verbose debug logs are generated and printed to `stdout`. When an interaction is detected a log is created to record the behavior, otherwise periodically a heartbeat is logged to confirm to the operator the honeypot is alive and listening.

![logs](/img/005-logs.png)

### Password Guessing
We can see an example of password gueesing in the log snippet below. IP `113.128.246.50` attempts to login to `HoneyTrap` over port `22` using the password `adminbigdata`:

![login test attempt](/img/005-logs2.png)

After successfully guessing or cracking the `HoneyTrap` login credentials (username="`root`" password "`password`") the attacker will see the following fake Ubuntu prompt.

![login test attempt](/img/005-fakelogin.png)

Any attempted commands appear in the logs character by character. An `exit` command would appear in the logs as:

![successful login behavior log](/img/005-loginbehavior.png)

### Logging Behaviors
In another example, the value `ssh.exec[]` stores the movements of an attacker from source ip `71.214.59.235` sending exec commands over ssh (without logging in). They send 9 commands before realizing they are in a honeypot, at which point they say hello before disconnecting. Below you can see a screenshot of the logs storing `ssh.exec[]` values and then the entered commands in plaintext.

![Realize its a honeypot](/img/005-hello.png)
```
/ip cloud print
ifconfig
uname -a
cat /proc/cpuinfo
ps | grep '[Mm]iner'
ls -la /dev/ttyGSM* /dev/ttyUSB-mod* /var/spool/sms/* /var/log/smsd.log /etc/smsd.conf* /usr/bin/qmuxd /var/qmux_connect_socket /etc/config/simman /dev/modem* /var/config/sms/*
echo Hi | cat -n
```

## Analysis

To collect information from docker, output the logs to a text file and move the text file to another workstation for log ingestion and analysis.

```
sudo docker logs CONTAINER_NAME > OUTPUTFILE.txt
```

### Script
I made a script to parse the logs for some basic information including source-ip addresses, commands, and usernames/passwords attempted. Check out the gist [here](https://gist.github.com/malwaremily/1d1944862cf1af5886c0787ba428b661).

## Final Thoughts
Hosting honeypots on cloud architecture enables security researchers to quickly experiement without endangering local networks. It is not without its own considerations, the researcher should monitor and secure the research workstation and have a plan in the event of compromise. Open-source honeypots are commonly criticized for being easy to detect, evade, and come with security vulnerabilities of their own. In additon to making a plan for the honeypot lifecycle, make a plan for log collection and ingestion to automate log analysis and data visualization.

Additionally, the default username of the cloud machine will be the username of the gmail address used by GCP. A researcher using `firstnameLastname@gmail[dot]com` may allow an attacker to identify the first and last name of the researcher. This can be mitigated by adding a new user to the honeypot and removing the old `firstnameLastname` user. Usernames associated with social media account present similar concerns. Note also at the time of compute instance creation, the hostname set in the networking section defaults to `HOSTNAME.REGION.PROJECT_NAME.internal` where PROJECT_NAME and hosting region are exposed.
