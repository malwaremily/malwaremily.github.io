Malware Lab Plans The malware lab must meet the following requirements:
Malware environment must not connect to prod/shared networks. Dedicated physical workstation to host malware lab. (i.e. an old laptop) Quickly restore host in the event of malware escape. Include both static and dynamic analysis features. WARNING: Conduct all security research on an isolated network seperate from shared/personal devices.</description></item></channel></rss>
