      <description>Updated: 2021-02-28 - Update detection section to explain why v.py might not be flagged by AV.  Updated: 2021-03-03 - Divide article by LM Kill Chain phases instead of MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK framework. 
Case Summary I collect live malware samples from honeypots running on public cloud servers. This case examines a repeated security event following a successful bruteforce attack against SSH where malware payloads ninfo and v.py are dropped from nasapaul[.</description>

      <description>Curious about BigQuery? This super quick tutorial will help you get started. BigQuery is a Google Cloud Platform service that provides serverless, scalable data analysis fast. This tutorial will discuss the basics of working with BigQuery including how to create datasets and tables, upload information to them, and how to make queries using the BigQuery command-line interface tool bq.
Pre-Config In order to follow along, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to have done the following:</description>

Last month, I wrote a post about setting up honeypots on GCP where I stood up a low-interaction SSH honeypot. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to log a few megabytes worth of unauthorized behavior. This post will report on a repeated security event targeting misconfigured MikroTik routers.
 Event Behavior The attacker logs into the honeypot using admin/password and then sends the commands seen below into the honeypot terminal.</description>

      <description>Updated 2021-03-01: Give the reader a heads up that restarting SSH will kick them from their current session.
Overview Honeypots are useful tools for collecting unauthorized interactions as logs. These logs can be digested to identify new attacking techniques or observe active username/password patterns. In the context of a security team, it could provide actionable information to pre-emptively secure the studied environment.
This tutorial will discuss general SSH honeypot pre-configuration, HoneyTrap installation, logging, and analysis.</description>
